# Summary

I built a Brain-Computer-Interface that leveraged the EEG signal out of a wearable EEG Sensor through LSL (Lab Streaming Layer). This project involves data sensing, transformation, signal processing and Machine Learning modeling pipelines whose ultimate aim was to provide a customized output of the program. The mentiones output was a song sensitive to the sensed individualâ€™s emotions and the extracted features from the EEG signal. It consists in an executable project built in Python Language and it needs a wearable EEG device to emit a signal that the further program collects, processes and finally decides which song to play.

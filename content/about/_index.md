Hey there! 👋 I'm **Alejo Pérez Gómez**, originally from the breathtaking landscapes of Spain 🇪🇸. My journey began with a degree in **Biomedical Engineering**, where I dived deep into the world of **Medical Imaging** and **Deep Learning**. 🧬🔬

Nevertheless, my heart was captivated by **Machine Learning** and **Statistics**, and I decided to take my passion to **Sweden** 🇸🇪. After a stint at the **University of Linköping**, I found myself in the heart of Stockholm in early 2022, thanks to an exciting internship at **Huawei**. 🚀

Today, I'm proudly part of the **Scania's** team, working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** 🧑‍💻.

Beyond the code and data, I live for thrilling hobbies such as acrobatics 🤸‍♂️, Muay Thai 🥊, weightlifting 🏋️, playing guitar 🎸 and the magic of cinema 🎥. 

Welcome to my portfolio! Dive in to explore my projects and adventures. Let's embark on this exciting journey together! 🌟🚀
